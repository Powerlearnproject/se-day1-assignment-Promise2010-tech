#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the use of sofware engineering tools and principles to produce reliable software products.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Problem solving, the issue is identified and the requirements of solving the problem are evaluated.
Logical and Creative Thinking, structures and ideas are generated through creative thinking and logic.
Implementation, the product is designed, coding is done, the product is tested then consequently deployed through meeting the requirements.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Analysis of the issue/challenge, this is where software engineers analyse the issue and use their problem solving skills to determine the type of software that can solve the issue at hand.
Product development, software engineers develop the sofware product that seems suitable to solve the problem.
Product Testing, software engineers put their software product into practice by checking whether the product functions at the required standard.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

The waterfall methodology is a methodology used to develop a software product by following a rigid sequence, a sequence that cannot be changed. On the other hand, the Agile methodology is used to develop a product by following a flexible approach that can be changed based on user review. The waterfall methodology can be used in developing a small project because small products have clearly defined requirements. This provides less reasons for a further development on the software product. The Agile methodology is a changeable approach in developing a software product. This methodology can be used in instances where the quality of the product needs future improvement. Further more, it may be used in instances where the Software Engineers, want to maintain transparency with the clients in the development of the software product. 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

A Software Engineer writes code and implements sofware solutions to the problem at hand
A Quality Assurance Enginner ensures that the software meets the required quality by designing testing plans
A Project Manager overseas the planning, execution and delivery of the software as a product 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Intergrated Development Environments are established facilities they are important because they enable Software Engineers to write code, test the functionality of the code and develop software. These facilities consist of source code editors, built in automation tools and a debugger. One example of a IDE is Pycharm. Version Control Systems are important because they provide tools that enable developers to save and keep track of any modification made to a project. One example of a VCS  is Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

1. Changes in the requirments of a software product during the development cycle.
1.1. A strategy to overcome this challenge would be the implementation of a Agile Methodology in the development of the Software Product, this allows the clients to directly communicate the desired changes of the software making it easier for the developers to identify the key and significant changes based on the majority review of the product.

2. Tight Deadlines.
   2.1. One strategy that can be used to overcome this challenge is task prioritisation. Developers should rather focus on tasks that are essentitial for the success of the project, through this strategy the most important work will be done first to save time.  


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

1. Unit Testing is the testing of individual component of software. 2. Intergration testing focuses on the interaction of components of software rather than an individual component. 3.Acceptance testing is the testing of the entire software instead of the software components, against the user requirements.

2. Importance of quality assurance is that quality assurance ensures that the software product meets all the user requirments and is up to standard before being delivered to the user.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt Engineering refers to the act of setting up AI to give you fully detailed responses based on your questions by avoiding vague answers from AI. Such is important because it allows you to get the best rest responses from AI.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

1. Vague Prompt.
   1.1. Why do we use dictionaries to store information.
2. Improved Promt.
   2.1. Why do we use dictionaries to store data in python through programing.

3. Why the impoved prompt is more effective
   3.1. The improved prompt is more effective becuase it does not entirely ask about dictionaries in general, but specifically refers to dictionaries within the programming language, python.
